### 🧠 About Me

Hey there! I’m d3vniks, a passionate coder and curious hacker-in-training. I thrive on learning by doing, breaking things (ethically), and building them back better. I use technology not just as a tool but as a gateway to endless possibilities — from automating repetitive tasks to diving deep into cybersecurity.

- 🖥️ Linux lover running Parrot OS daily — because nothing beats that hacker vibe 😎
- 🔐 Enthusiast of cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and understanding systems from the inside out
- 🤖 Automation fanatic — if it can be scripted, it will be
- 🌱 Always growing, learning new languages, frameworks, and hacking skills

### 🌱 My Tech Journey So Far

I started as a newbie, overwhelmed by the vastness of coding and hacking worlds. But curiosity got the best of me, and I dove in headfirst. From writing simple Python scripts to building Telegram bots and dabbling in CTF challenges, each step taught me valuable lessons.

- Began with Python scripting for automation and small hacks
- Progressed to web development basics — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Exploring backend with Node.js and databases like MongoDB
- Learning to build real-world tools like temp mail apps, Telegram bots, and domain-selling sites
- Constantly practicing ethical hacking via Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and tool usage

---

### 🔥 Current Focus Areas

Right now, I’m focused on sharpening my skills and building projects that push me outside my comfort zone:

- **Full-stack Web Development:** Mastering HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to create dynamic, responsive apps
- **Ethical Hacking:** Understanding security basics, networking, penetration testing tools like Nmap, Wireshark, sqlmap, and setting up proxychains
- **Telegram Bots & Automation:** Creating bots with Python to automate workflows, post predictions, and interact seamlessly on Telegram
- **APIs & Custom Tools:** Building and consuming APIs for practical projects like temp mail services and domain selling platforms
- **Linux & Terminal Mastery:** Using ZSH, oh-my-zsh, custom themes, and terminal utilities daily to improve productivity
